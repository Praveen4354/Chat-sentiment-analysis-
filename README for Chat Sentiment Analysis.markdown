A Streamlit web application that analyzes the sentiment of chat messages, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral using a pre-trained Transformer model from Hugging Face. Users can input a chat message (e.g., "I love this app!"), view the sentiment score, and see a visual representation of the result. The project leverages a pre-trained model for efficient sentiment analysis and is deployable on Renderâ€™s free tier for public access.
